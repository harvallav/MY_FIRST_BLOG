## INTRODUCTION

Hello. How are you? Let us begin this journey of majdoori together.

## My first piece of Rcode

First, we are setting up the packages.Well what packages are? they are collections of R functions, data, and documentation that extend the functionality of R.

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(babynames)
```

```{r}
babynames
```

```{r}
glimpse(babynames)
```


```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=='Anhad')%>%
gf_line(n ~ year)
```

Wow, Anhad feels popular but little does he know that he is just common.

```{r}
babynames %>%  filter(name=='Arvind') %>% 
gf_line(n ~ year)

```
